# Fibonacci Finder

## Problem Description

Find the **Nth Fibonacci number**, where the Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1
- F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n ≥ 2

## Input Format

- A single integer `N` representing which Fibonacci number to find
- N will be between 0 and 30

## Output Format

- A single integer: the Nth Fibonacci number

## Example

**Input:**
```
10
```

**Output:**
```
55
```

## Explanation

The Fibonacci sequence is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...

The 10th number (0-indexed) is 55.

## Notes

- The sequence is 0-indexed (F(0) = 0)
- Your solution should handle N = 0 correctly
